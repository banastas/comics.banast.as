## Data Management

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: `src/data/comics.json` - Main comic collection data
- **Format**: JSON array of Comic objects
- **Schema**: Defined in `src/types/Comic.ts` with Zod validation
- **Backup**: Export functionality for data backup and migration

### State Management Architecture
The project uses a hybrid approach during transition:

1. **Modern (Preferred)**: Zustand store in `src/stores/comicStore.ts`
2. **Legacy**: React hooks in `src/hooks/useComics.ts`

**Note**: When making changes, prefer the Zustand store approach as it's the target architecture.

### CSV Import Process
1. **Prepare CSV** with required columns (see usage section)
2. **Access Converter** via file icon in header
3. **Upload CSV file** for validation and conversion
4. **Download JSON** file with converted data
5. **Replace** existing `comics.json` file

## Development

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Lint code

# Additional development commands
npm run dev:debug    # Start with debugging enabled
npm run analyze      # Analyze bundle size
```

### Code Organization

#### Component Architecture
- **Core Layout**: `App.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx` for main structure
- **Display Components**: `ComicCard.tsx`, `ComicListView.tsx` for collection views
- **Detail Views**: Lazy-loaded components for individual item details
- **Utility Components**: `ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ResponsiveImage.tsx` for shared functionality

#### State Flow
1. **Data Loading**: JSON data loaded on app startup
2. **State Management**: Zustand store manages centralized state
3. **Component Subscription**: Components subscribe to specific store slices
4. **Filtering/Sorting**: Handled by `useComicFilters` hook
5. **Performance**: Monitored via `usePerformance` hook

### Best Practices
- Use **TypeScript** for all new components
- Implement **lazy loading** for detail views
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Add **error boundaries** for component isolation
- Use **Zustand store** for new state management
- Implement **proper loading states** and fallbacks

## Performance

### Optimization Features
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded detail pages reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with WebP support and fallbacks
- **Bundle Optimization**: Separate chunks for vendors, utilities, and components
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in utilities for tracking performance metrics
- **Memory Management**: Efficient state management with Zustand

### Performance Budgets
- **JavaScript Bundle**: <250KB gzipped
- **CSS Bundle**: <50KB gzipped  
- **Images**: WebP format with lazy loading
- **Fonts**: Subset and preload critical fonts

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Detail views load on demand
- **Skeleton Screens**: Smooth loading experience
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## Migration & Updates

### State Management Migration
The project is transitioning from React hooks to Zustand:
- **Current**: Mixed approach with both systems
- **Target**: Full Zustand implementation
- **Migration**: Gradual component-by-component migration

### Data Model Evolution
- **Flexible Schema**: Easy addition of new comic properties
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing data
- **Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas prevent data corruption

## Known Limitations

- **Data Storage**: Uses JSON file instead of database (easily upgradeable)
- **Single User**: No authentication or multi-user support currently
- **Image Hosting**: Cover images must be hosted externally
- **Manual Backup**: No automated backup or sync features

## Future Enhancements

### Near Term
- **Complete Zustand Migration**: Finish state management transition
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite implementation
- **PWA Features**: Offline functionality and app installation
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options

### Long Term  
- **Database Integration**: Migration to PostgreSQL/Supabase
- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with personal collections
- **Image Upload**: Direct cover image upload and hosting
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **Cloud Sync**: Cross-device synchronization
- **Community Features**: Collection sharing and social features
