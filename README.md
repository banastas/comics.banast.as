## 📚 Adding Your Collection Data

The app comes with sample data, but you'll want to add your own comics. Here's how:

### Method 1: Use the Built-in CSV Converter (Easiest)

1. **Prepare your data** in a CSV file with these columns:
   ```csv
   title,seriesName,issueNumber,releaseDate,coverImageUrl,coverArtist,grade,purchasePrice,purchaseDate,currentValue,notes,signedBy,storageLocation,tags,isSlabbed,isVariant,isGraphicNovel
   ```

2. **Access the converter** by clicking the file upload icon in the app header

3. **Upload your CSV** and download the converted JSON file

4. **Replace** `src/data/comics.json` with your new file

5. **Restart the development server** to see your collection

### Method 2: Manual JSON Editing (Advanced)

1. **Open** `src/data/comics.json` in a text editor

2. **Replace the content** with your comic data using this format:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "unique-id-1",
       "title": "The Amazing Spider-Man",
       "seriesName": "The Amazing Spider-Man",

## Data Management

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: `src/data/comics.json` - Main comic collection data
- **Format**: JSON array of Comic objects
- **Schema**: Defined in `src/types/Comic.ts` with Zod validation
- **Backup**: Export functionality for data backup and migration

### State Management Architecture
The project uses a hybrid approach during transition:

1. **Modern (Preferred)**: Zustand store in `src/stores/comicStore.ts`
2. **Legacy**: React hooks in `src/hooks/useComics.ts`

**Note**: When making changes, prefer the Zustand store approach as it's the target architecture.

### CSV Import Process
1. **Prepare CSV** with required columns (see usage section)
2. **Access Converter** via file icon in header
3. **Upload CSV file** for validation and conversion
4. **Download JSON** file with converted data
5. **Replace** existing `comics.json` file

## Development

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Lint code

# Additional development commands
npm run dev:debug    # Start with debugging enabled
npm run analyze      # Analyze bundle size
```

### Code Organization

#### Component Architecture
- **Core Layout**: `App.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx` for main structure
- **Display Components**: `ComicCard.tsx`, `ComicListView.tsx` for collection views
- **Detail Views**: Lazy-loaded components for individual item details
- **Utility Components**: `ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ResponsiveImage.tsx` for shared functionality

#### State Flow
1. **Data Loading**: JSON data loaded on app startup
2. **State Management**: Zustand store manages centralized state
3. **Component Subscription**: Components subscribe to specific store slices
4. **Filtering/Sorting**: Handled by `useComicFilters` hook
5. **Performance**: Monitored via `usePerformance` hook

### Best Practices
- Use **TypeScript** for all new components
- Implement **lazy loading** for detail views
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Add **error boundaries** for component isolation
- Use **Zustand store** for new state management
- Implement **proper loading states** and fallbacks

## Performance

### Optimization Features
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded detail pages reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with WebP support and fallbacks
- **Bundle Optimization**: Separate chunks for vendors, utilities, and components
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in utilities for tracking performance metrics
- **Memory Management**: Efficient state management with Zustand

### Performance Budgets
- **JavaScript Bundle**: <250KB gzipped
- **CSS Bundle**: <50KB gzipped  
- **Images**: WebP format with lazy loading
- **Fonts**: Subset and preload critical fonts

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Detail views load on demand
- **Skeleton Screens**: Smooth loading experience
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## Browser Support

### Desktop Browsers
- Chrome 90+ ✅
- Firefox 88+ ✅  
- Safari 14+ ✅
- Edge 90+ ✅

### Mobile Browsers
- iOS Safari 14+ ✅
- Chrome Mobile 90+ ✅

### Accessibility
- **WCAG AA Compliant**: Proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and live regions
- **Touch Accessibility**: Minimum 44x44px touch targets

## Migration & Updates

### State Management Migration
The project is transitioning from React hooks to Zustand:
- **Current**: Mixed approach with both systems
- **Target**: Full Zustand implementation
- **Migration**: Gradual component-by-component migration

### Data Model Evolution
- **Flexible Schema**: Easy addition of new comic properties
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing data
- **Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas prevent data corruption

## Known Limitations

- **Data Storage**: Uses JSON file instead of database (easily upgradeable)
- **Single User**: No authentication or multi-user support currently
- **Image Hosting**: Cover images must be hosted externally
- **Manual Backup**: No automated backup or sync features

## Future Enhancements

### Near Term
- **Complete Zustand Migration**: Finish state management transition
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite implementation
- **PWA Features**: Offline functionality and app installation
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options

### Long Term  
- **Database Integration**: Migration to PostgreSQL/Supabase
- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with personal collections
- **Image Upload**: Direct cover image upload and hosting
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **Cloud Sync**: Cross-device synchronization
- **Community Features**: Collection sharing and social features

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "npm install" fails
- **Make sure you have Node.js 18+** installed
- **Try clearing npm cache**: `npm cache clean --force`
- **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json**, then run `npm install` again

#### App won't start after adding your data
- **Check your JSON syntax** - use a JSON validator
- **Make sure all required fields** are present in each comic object
- **Restart the development server** after changing data files

#### Images not loading
- **Use HTTPS URLs** for cover images when possible
- **Check that image URLs are accessible** from your browser
- **Consider using a free image hosting service** like Imgur or Cloudinary

#### Build fails
- **Check for TypeScript errors**: `npm run lint`
- **Make sure all imports are correct**
- **Verify your data structure** matches the expected format
